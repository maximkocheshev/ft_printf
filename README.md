# Printf
## Mandatory part
The aim of the mandatory part is to write a library that contains ft_printf, a function that will mimic the real printf without flags and field width.
## Bonus part
The aim of the bonus part is to write a library that contains ft_printf, a function that will mimic the real printf and manage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.’ and minimum field width with all conversions and all the following flags: ’# +’ (one of them is a space).
